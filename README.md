# Predictive-Analysis-of-Environmental-Changes-Using-Sentinel-2-Imagery-and-Machine-Learning


## Project Overview
This project addresses critical global environmental issues, such as rapid urbanization and natural resource depletion, by utilizing high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, part of the European Union's Copernicus program. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict future changes in land cover, including the area and density of vegetation, water bodies, and urban regions. These predictions are intended to support sustainable development goals by providing actionable insights for environmental management and urban planning.
